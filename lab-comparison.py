# Scenario
# Using one of the comparison operators in Python 
    # write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, which is an integer 
    # prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100
    # Don't create any if blocks

# Def
n = int(input("any numbers : "))

# Driver Code
print(n <= 100)
print(n >= 100)
