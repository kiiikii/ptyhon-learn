# Scenario
# ----------
# Your task is 
    # to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). 
    # The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.
        # For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------
            # Don't worry about any imperfections in your code :
                # it's okay if it accepts an invalid time 
                # the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.
                # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    # Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.

hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# put your code here
print("finish time : ", ((hour+(mins+dura)//60)%24),":",((mins+dura)%60))
